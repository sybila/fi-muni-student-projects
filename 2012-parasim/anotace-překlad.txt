The goal of this project is a tool for analysis of dynamic systems specified
in terms of ordinary differential equations.

As a feature distinct from existing tools used for dynamic systems analysis
and temporal properties monitoring,

this [our] tool will be based on a modular architecture,

which should greatly facilitate future optimalization and parallelization of individual
modules and algorithms used for analysis,

as well as implementation of additional functionality.
